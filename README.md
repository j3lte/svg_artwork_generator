# SVG Artwork Generator

Generating SVG grids in your browser, using [SVG.js](https://svgjs.dev/). Other libraries used:

- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)

The generator is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and runs as a PWA (Progressive Web App)

## Development

I have made the code of this generator open source, so you can add generators if you want, and test them out. I'd love to get your generators as a PR!

### Running locally

- Clone the project
- Install the dependencies: `yarn`
- Run locally: `yarn dev`
